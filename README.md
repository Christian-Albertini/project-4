UNC Project 4

Our project is designed to look at end-of-season statistics from MLB players who played at least 80 games in a season from 2013-2023 and predict who made an All-Star Appearance.  This data could be used to see if fans vote for the best players each year or if various biases affect the results.  We used data from Baseball Reference to collect specific stats, such as batting average, runs scored, wins-above-replacement, and end-of-season standings for each player's team.  We created machine learning models, both logistic regression and Random Forest, to attempt to find the best model for predicting All-Stars.  We created visualizations from our data and the classification reports from our models.  We were able to create a model that could achieve over 80% classification accuracy and over 80% recall, which were the two stats we were most interested in.  Our various attempts at creating models can be seen in the different files that have "Project_4" in them, with different parameters for each model.  As we created more models, we were able to discover statistics that didn't influence our models greatly and remove them over time.

# Code Assistance
We took inspiration from previous assignments and classwork for creating our models and cleaning our datasets.
